# Project Title

Coin Watch

## Description

This project allows you to create alerts for specific coins *(Bitcoin for now)* and get notified when the price of the coin matches the alert price.  
Watching of price happens using the [binance websocket](wss://stream.binance.com:9443/ws/btcusdt@trade).  
Alerts are created using simple endpoints. The postman collection can be found in this project.
